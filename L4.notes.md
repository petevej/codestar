# Javascript - Iteration

## Environment

1. Mac OSX 10.12.4
2. Visual Studio Code 1.14.2
3. Node JS v8.2.1

### Notes

* Check what is the answer of this function?
```javascript
function hello() {
	var x = 8;
	if ( x > 0 ) {
	var x = 7;
	}
	console.log(x);
}
hello();	// 7
```
* There's another way to declare a variable using 'let' which declares a block scope local variable - inside {} is the same scope:
```javascript
function hello() {
	let x = 8
}
console.log(x);
hello();	// 8
```
* 'let' came out to fix the mistake of 'var'
* Create a new folder called "demo" and a file within it called "demo.js"
```javascript
console.log('Hello Node.js');
```
* You can run the script straight from within VSC using fn + f5
* If you have 2 or more functions of the same name, the function at the bottom will get called
* Hoisting describes how javascript looks ahead to find the function if it's called earlier
```javascript
hello();
function hello() {
    console.log('Welcome to javascript');
}
```
* However, hoisting will still call the last function declared (one at the bottom) 
* ES5 only allowed two types of quotation marks: '' and "" but ES6+ added one more type: `` - grave accent
```javascript
var s = 'I love you'
var t = "I love you"
var u = `I love you`
```
* One good thing about `` grave accent is that you can put texts on multiple lines like so:
```javascript
var v = `I love you
so much`
// I love you
// so much
* Another good thing about `` is that you can output the value of a variable within the string:
```javascript
var pokemon = 5;
var s = `You have ${pokemon} pokemons.`

console.log(s);
```
