# HTML5, Bootstrap, CSS, Responsive

## Environment

1. Mac OSX
2. Visual Studio Code

### Notes

* Download Visual Studio Code
* Register Google Cloud - 365 Day free trial
* Create folder for project "codestar", and internal folder called "web", drag it onto VSC screen
* Create a new file "index.html" in the "web" folder
* In the "index.html" file, add:

```html
<i>Welcome</i>
```

* How to be good at coding:

1. Must practice a LOT
2. Know the things that are most commonly used

* Have you done anything consistently for a year? Have you noticed how far you can get by doing it for a year? Example: "Expert in a year table tennis" youtube video
* HTML consists of a number of (~100) tags, very much like merchandise tags
* A HTML document must have:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
</html>
```
in the structure.
```html
<head> <!-- for collecting meta information about the page -->
<body> <!-- the displayed part of the web -->
<meta> <!-- this goes inside the <body> tag, contains information e.g. type of encoding used -->
<meta charset='utf-8'> <!-- utf-8 encoding specification -->
<p> <!-- paragraph tag, used for regular text -->
<i> <!-- italics tag, used for emphasis -->
<b> <!-- bold tag -->
<h1> <!-- largest header -->
..
<h6> <!-- smallest header -->
```
* Default font used in the browser is "serif", although not commonly used anymore...
* Black is nota  recommended font color for a web page, its known to cause eye strain
* Bootstrap framework can be used to creat a more visually-pleasing page
* Quote from Steve Jobs/Picasso: "Good artists copy, great artists steal" - referring to the idea of a "mouse" which they stole from Xerox
* Download Bootstrap 4.0 > Unzip > you'll get 2 folders: [css, js] > move them to "web" folder that contains the index.html file > you can now reference the stylesheet and begin using them
* In order to use Bootstrap, you must link the .css stylesheet first > referesh > get sans serif fonts
* Best practice for an easy-to-read website: font: sans-serif, color: almost black

```html
<div class="container">  <!-- add a container to the html page -->
```
* If you want to get an idea of how great websites look, simply print them out and review them over time to get inspiration
* Class can be added to html tags such as <p>Latte...</p>, you'll get <p class="signature">Latte..</p> and within the .css file or <style> tag, you can add the color for it
