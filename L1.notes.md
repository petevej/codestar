# HTML5, Bootstrap, CSS, Responsive

## Environment

1. Mac OSX 10.12.4
2. Visual Studio Code 1.14.2

### Notes

* Download Visual Studio Code
* Register Google Cloud - 365 Day free trial
* Create folder for project "codestar", and internal folder called "web", drag it onto VSC screen
* Create a new file "index.html" in the "web" folder
* In the "index.html" file, add:

```html
<i>Welcome</i>
```

* How to be good at coding:

1. Must practice a LOT
2. Know the things that are most commonly used

* Have you done anything consistently for a year? Have you noticed how far you can get by doing it for a year? Example: "Expert in a year table tennis" youtube video
* HTML consists of a number of (~100) tags, very much like merchandise tags
* A HTML document must have:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
</html>
```
in the structure.
```html
<head> <!-- for collecting meta information about the page -->
<body> <!-- the displayed part of the web -->
<meta> <!-- this goes inside the <body> tag, contains information e.g. type of encoding used -->
<meta charset='utf-8'> <!-- utf-8 encoding specification -->
<p> <!-- paragraph tag, used for regular text -->
<i> <!-- italics tag, used for emphasis -->
<b> <!-- bold tag -->
<h1> <!-- largest header -->
..
<h6> <!-- smallest header -->
```
* Default font used in the browser is "serif", although not commonly used anymore...
* Black is nota  recommended font color for a web page, its known to cause eye strain
* Bootstrap framework can be used to creat a more visually-pleasing page
* Quote from Steve Jobs/Picasso: "Good artists copy, great artists steal" - referring to the idea of a "mouse" which they stole from Xerox
* Download Bootstrap 4.0 > Unzip > you'll get 2 folders: [css, js] > move them to "web" folder that contains the index.html file > you can now reference the stylesheet and begin using them
* In order to use Bootstrap, you must link the .css stylesheet first > referesh > get sans serif fonts
* Best practice for an easy-to-read website: font: sans-serif, color: almost black

```html
<div class="container">  <!-- add a container to the html page -->
```
* If you want to get an idea of how great websites look, simply print them out and review them over time to get inspiration
* Class can be added to html tags such as:

```html
<p>Latte...</p>
```
you'll get

```html
<p class="signature">Latte..</p>
```
and within the .css file or 

```html
<style>
	.signature {
		color: brown;
	}
</style>
```
tag, you can add the color for it.
* You could always add more than 1 class, e.g. "signature" and "test" for the Latte...
* Bootstrap has many classes that can be referred and used right away
* Next, add the id to the Mocha tag and change the font color to black, in the CSS, refer to id's using #id
* Apart from class and id, you can target html elements directly in CSS as well
* If you want to add a button, use:
```html
<button class="btn btn-primary">Shop</button>
```
* If the customer wants buttons in other colors, use a new class to tag the button and change the background color to a new one, e.g.
```html
<style>
	.btn-special {
		background: green;
	}
</style>

<button class="btn btn-primary btn-special">Shop</button>
```
* CSS has ~200 properties, commonly used ones are around 20
* Apart from btn-primary, there are also btn-secondary, btn-success, btn-info, btn-warning, btn-danger classes as well
* If you want to go to a new line you can use:
```html
<br>
```
* Another property you may change for the button in CSS is *border-color*
* Psudo-classes can be used in CSS to target certain state as well:
```css
selector:pseudo-class {
    property:value;
}

.btn-primary:hover {
	background: orange;
	border-color: yellow;
}
```
* Pseudo-class :hover is used for targeting cursor movement on a laptop, while :active is used for targeting cursor on mobile
* You can always change the width and height for the button e.g. width: 120px;
* Margin is used for creating space between each element, there are 4 directions, margin-left/-right/-top/-bottom e.g.:
```css
.btn-success {
	margin-left: 20px;
}
```
* Padding is used for creating space between the internal border and the content, there are 4 directions as well: padding-left/-right/-top/-bottom
* What is responsive? Responsive is the adjustment of how content is displayed on different viewports
* To create a reponsive page, add this meta tag to the head:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```
* Now that we've made the page responsive, let's see how we can use *row* to arrange the content on page
```html
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
	</div>
</div>
<!-- within each row, you can dictate the size on each screen size-->
<div class="row col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 col-xl-3">
</div>
```
* The size number following the viewport spec is the number of rows the div will occupy out of the 12 total
