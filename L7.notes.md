# MySQL

## Environment

1. Mac OSX 10.12.4
2. Visual Studio Code 1.14.2
3. Google Cloud Ubuntu 17.04

### Main Concepts



#### Notes

* Create a new Ubuntu 17.04 instance on Google Cloud
* Remote ssh in using:
```shell
gcloud compute ssh [NAME]
```
* On the gcloud engine, use:
```shell
sudo apt install mysql-server
```
* Enter root password for mysql
* Log into myqsl database using:
```shell
mysql -u root -p
```
* Display databases using:
```mysql
show databases;
create database company;
```
* To delete a database "company", use:
```mysql
drop database company;
```
* Re-create the database to start interacting with it
* Create 2 tables: "Employee" and "Department"
```mysql
use company;
```
* Create a new table called "department":
* Use the following types for each data field:
1. did - int
2. name - varchar(100)
3. salary - double
```mysql
create table department (
	did int,
	name varchar(100),
	salary double
);
```
* Insert data into the department table:
```mysql
insert into department(did, name, salary)
	values(1, 'programmer', 30000);
```
* Select data from the table using "select", use "*" to display all:
```mysql
select * from department;
```
* To select a specific field from the table, use select [FIELDNAME] from [TABLENAME]
```mysql
select name from department;
```
* Create a new table called "employee" with the following data fields:
1. eid - int
2. name - varchar(100)
3. age - int
4. sex - char
5. did - int
```mysql
create table employee (
	eid int,
	name varchar(100),
	age int,
	sex char,
	did int
);
```
* Insert some dummy data:
```mysql
insert into employee(eid, name, age, sex, did)
	values(1, 'A', 25, 'M', 1);
insert into employee(eid, name, age, sex, did)
	values(2, 'B', 30, 'F', 1);
insert into employee(eid, name, age, sex, did)
	values(3, 'C', 31, 'F', 2);
insert into employee(eid, name, age, sex, did)
	values(4, 'D', 33, 'F', 2);
insert into employee(eid, name, age, sex, did)
	values(5, 'E', 23, 'F', 3);
insert into employee(eid, name, age, sex, did)
	values(6, 'F', 20, 'M', 3);
insert into employee(eid, name, age, sex, did)
	values(7, 'G', 22, 'M', 4);
insert into employee(eid, name, age, sex, did)
	values(8, 'H', 30, 'F', 4);
insert into employee(eid, name, age, sex, did)
	values(9, 'I', 25, 'F', 5);
insert into employee(eid, name, age, sex, did)
	values(9, 'J', 26, 'F', 5);
```
* YOu can also insert multiple lists of column values like so:
```mysql
insert into employee
	(eid, name, age, sex, did)
values
	(1, 'A', 25, 'M', 1),
	(2, 'B', 30, 'F', 1),
	(3, 'C', 31, 'F', 2),
	(4, 'D', 33, 'F', 2)
	(5, 'E', 23, 'F', 3),
	(6, 'F', 20, 'M', 3),
	(7, 'G', 22, 'M', 4),
	(8, 'H', 30, 'F', 4),
	(9, 'I', 25, 'F', 5),
	(9, 'J', 26, 'F', 5);
```
* To select employees who are Male only:
```mysql
select * from employee where sex = 'M';
```
* You can use functions to calculate different values e.g. avg(), sum():
```mysql
select avg(salary)
from department;
```
* To remove a certain line from the tale use the "delete" command:
```mysql
delete from department where did = 5;
```
* To chain multiple conditions together, use "and"/"or":
```mysql
select * from employee where sex='F' and age < 30;
select * from employee where sex='M' and did = 1;
select * from employee where sex'F' or age < 20;
```
* Join - join two or more tables together:
```mysql
select * from employee, department;
```
* Compute average salary from department and output as a new variable:

```mysql
select avg(salary) as AVERAGE_SALARY from department;
```
* Inner Join - take 2 or more tables and merge them based on a certain condition(s):
```mysql
select * from department d inner join employee e
on d.did = e.did
where d.salary < 50000;

select * from department d inner join employee e
on d.did = e.did
where d.salary < 50000 and sex='F';

select * from department d inner join employee e
on d.did = e.did
where d.salary < 50000
order by d.salary;

select * from department d inner join employee e
on d.did = e.did
where d.name = 'Programmer'
and d.salary > 20000
and e.sex = 'F';
```
* For commonly used query, you can use "create view [VIEWNAME] as" to create a new table:
```mysql
create view salary as
select * from department where salary > 30000;
```
* Update - update new info in table, change employee name to 'J' for field where eid = 1:
```mysql
update employee set name='J'
	where eid=1;
```
* Backup and Rollback is highly recommended when using command "delete" and "update":
```mysql
start transaction;
# wrong update
rollback;

start transaction;
# correct update
commit;
```
* Exercise: find all programmers whose age is less than 30 or salary is greater than 20000 and rank them by salary
```mysql
select * from department d inner join employee e
on e.did = d.did
where e.did = 1
and (e.age < 30 OR d.salary > 20000)
order BY d.salary;
```
