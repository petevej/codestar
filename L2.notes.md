# Cloud, Domain, HTTP, IP

## Environment

1. Mac OSX 10.12.4
2. Visual Studio Code 1.14.2
3. Google Cloud Server: Ubuntu 17.04:
* Boot disc - Ubuntu 17.04
* Firewall - allow HTTP traffic
* Zone - SEA-a1
* Machine Type - micro 0.6 GB

### Notes
* Register and pay for Google Cloud
* Select *Compute Engine* > *Create Instance* (wait for some time) > set up as per Env.
* A book to read: "Eloquent Javascript"
* Note down the IP address of your VM instance e.g. 35.187.236.49
* Click on connect SSH to get a terminal CLI in browser > test by typing *pwd* or print working directory
* To connect from terminal do the following:
```shell
gcloud compute ssh [VM Instance Name]
```
e.g.:
```shell
gcloud compute ssh codestar-1
```


* Useful commands in Ubuntu:
```shell
pwd 			# print working directory
mkdir test 		# make folder called "test"
rmdir test 		# remove folder called "test"
ls 				# list files in curent dir
touch test.txt  # create a blank file called "test.txt"
vi user.txt     # create a file in vim called "user.txt"
```
* To use vim, use "i" to enter insert mode and "esc" to exit to command mode
```shell
:w 				# save file in vim
:q 				# quit in vim
:wq				# save and quit in vim
```
* Now that the cloud server has been created, you still can't see the website so you have to create a web server first
```shell
sudo apt install nginx		# superuser do - advanced packaging tool - install - nginx web server
```
* Refresh the site and you will see "Welcome to nginx..."
* Modify the landing page by going to:
```shell
sudo vi/var/www/html/index.html
```
* You could always create a new text file called "client.txt" and enter a list of names
```shell
cat client.txt 									# display information in "client.txt"
cat staff.txt client.txt 						# concatenate two files then display them together
cat staff.txt | sort							# use pipe "|" to chain two or more commands together
cat staff.txt client.txt | grep on 				# use regex to find "on" in the list of words
cat staff.txt client.txt | sort | grep o 		# concatenate > sort > regex find "o"
clear											# clear screen
cat staff.txt client.txt > meeting.txt 			# use redirect to create a new file after concat
cat staff.txt client.txt | sort > meeting.txt 	# pipe concat to sort and then redirect to a new file
cat staff.txt | sort							# display sorted text
sort < staff.txt 								# redirect input into the sort function
sort < staff.txt > result.txt 					# redirect input into the sort function and redirect the result to a file
sudo service nginx stop  						# stop nginx service
sudo service nginx start						# start nginx service
sudo apt install apache2 						# install Apache 2 webserver, must stop nginx first
sudo apt update 								# update all packages in the environment to allow Apache 2 installation
```
* Now that you have a web server, redirect the domain name to your google cloud, point the @ and www IP address in the registrar to your google cloud IP
